# UEFI
development of UEFI shell apps

This repository is devoted to store the development of UEFI shell apps.
There will be 3 main folders within it: Windows, Shell and Release.
1) Windows is for the development of concepts and testing implementation.
2) Shell will then hold the covertion of code developed under Windows
   into true UEFI shell source code.
3) Release is for completed projects.

It is assumed that you have Visual Studio and a copy of a UEFI development
source (downloaded from UEFI.org), and that you know how to create an
UEFI app. Code will be developed using public available UEFI stdin library.
